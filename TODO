some class take width as radian (r), not width / 2

a lot of render function where the angle is in radian

think about a better dead animation

collision should be check in GameScreen
bool Seen(const int& pos_x, const int& pos_y, const int& r) const;

clean up after running

the moving policy is not good enough, key up not realy set

GAMEGUI, CENTER OF THE OPTION LIST
