A EZ SDL game by Ngo Hai Dang

to move, press AWSD

have fun :))

* how to create your own map * 
Since this game load exactly with write in level/levelx.txt file, you have to define every tile, wall, BOT, player. I recommend writing a script for this.

see level/level_example.txt for the level file layout.
after writing the file, save it in the level/, with name level/levelx.txt, where x is the id.
then add it at the end of the anno/game_path.txt

That's all :)))
Have Fun create your own map and share with your friends :))
* fact * 

the owner of level1 can't beat it :))
